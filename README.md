Zipfile cracker v1.0 by TrollSkull

positional arguments:
  zipfile               zip file name here.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --passwfile PASSWFILE, -f PASSWFILE
                        if you have a password list for bruteforce, you can input using "-f passw.txt"
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                        number of instances of python, this will use more CPU, I recommend a maximum of 4 threads
```

## TEST FILES

You can test `ZipCracker` speed and power by using the files in the `/test` folder, the correct password will be in row `73722`, you can test changing the number of threads with `-t` and see the speed changes when using different threads.

`python zipcracker.py test/test.zip -t 4 -f test/wordlist.txt`
